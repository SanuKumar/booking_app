Go Language
+++++++++++
Created by Google in 2007
Open source in 2009


Simple Automation application and Command line interface application for Devops and SRE

Why it is needed
++++++++++++++++
1. Go was designed to run on multiple cores and built to support concurrency.
2. Concurrency in Go is cheap and easy.
3. For Performant Applications.
4. Running on scaled, distributed systems.

Characterstics of Go
++++++++++++++++++++
1. Simple and readable syntax of dynamically typed language like python.
2. Efficiency and safety of a lower-level, statically typed language like C++.
3. Simple Syntax: Easy to learn, read and write code.
4. Fast build time, start up and run
5. Requires fewer resources like CPU and RAM.


Go -- Server-Side and Compile Language --> Compiles into single binary(machine code)
++++++++++++++++++
Microservices
Web Applications
Database Services

main.go --> [] --> myapp.exe
Consistent across different OS


Multithreading
+++++++++++++
It allows to do multiple things at once without affecting any other task. 
Each thread process one task and we can have multiple of them running in parallel.

This makes application fast.

Challenges of Multithreading
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Multiple users editing the same documents.
Multiple users booking at the same time. 

Concurrency --> dealing with lots of things at once.
+++++++++++

Built-In Concurrency Mechanism                                No Built-In Concurreny Mechanism
------------------------------                                --------------------------------
C++,  JAVA,                -  Go                              Python,  Node JS
Complex code
Expensive and Slow


Concepts
++++++++
Data Types -> Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Slices, Maps, Structs
Variables and Constants
Formatted Output
User Input
Pointers
Scope Rules
Loops
If-else and Switch
Functions
Packages
Goroutines

GO Packages -> A packages is a collection of source files.
+++++++++++
1. Go Programs are organized into packages.
2. Go's standard library, provides different core packages for us to use.
3. "fmt" (format packages) is one of these, which you can use by importing it.
